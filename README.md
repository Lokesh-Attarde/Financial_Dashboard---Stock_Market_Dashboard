Dashboard Development using Google Data Studio.

"Numbers have plethora amount of hidden insights to describe the things", it depends on us how productively and efficiently we play with them to get the results.

The Stock Market Dashboard provides a glance at the current price and %changes for all the stock. Also, you can filter the stock to get detail idea about the Prices, Visual, Stock Volume, and its Market Value. Moreover, the report can provides a guide on the Top 5 Gainers and Top 5 Losers based on their performance from specific period.
